# LEEM_SubPixelEdgeAnalysis
This is a repo related to my PhD project. It detects and analyses steps/boundaries on LEEM images and spits out the statistics, as described by Hannon2001 (see both publications). 
It currently exists here only to make my personal use easier, sorry!

Currently in a state that is too task-specific and not made for ease of use. These will be done when publication is released, as part of that publication,
to enable easy application of the automated processes I use in the project.

Contains convenience functions for easy use of Elmitec LEEM .dat files. 

Comming next: A Front-End for ease of use. 
              Unit tests for each method.
